<p>Schwulst is able to explain the endless possibilities that a website is, through various metaphors. To me, a website is a canvas. It begins as a blank slate waiting to be painted. We add different elements and as we do, a beautiful image of self expression is born. It becomes something we are proud of and want to showcase. Websites are items of art which donâ€™t always get the recognition for their beauty. Schwulst began her article speaking of the loss of identity within social media. Art is all about self expression and building a website is no exception.</p>
